Software Development Capstone README

Once I started trying to develope the web app, I quickly realized I was too ambitious. The following is what I
decided to simplify my app down to be able to have a functioning app by the deadline.

Instead of a full fledged website, I decided to focus on one of the main functions I originally planned out 
for the app, that being, searching for patterns. 


Features:
1. Used a 3rd party API-- Ravelry
2. Lists-- The descriptors of the patterns i.e. Name, Author
3. Async-- Made asynce from using Json
4. Tables-- Also mad eiwth json if I remember correctly
